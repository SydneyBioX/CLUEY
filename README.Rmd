# CLUEY

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is an R package for estimating the number of clusters in uni and multi-modal single-cell data. CLUEY uses cell-type identity markers to guide the clustering process and performs recursive clusters to ensure 
that sub-populations are captured.

## Installation

CLUEY can be installed using the following command:

```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("SydneyBioX/CLUEY")
```

## Generating reference
We provide four references but you can generate your own references using the `generateReference` function like below:
```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```
